# FuelSync Hub - Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
FuelSync Hub is a multi-tenant SaaS platform for fuel station management. The system allows station owners to manage their fuel stations, pumps, nozzles, and sales records. It supports different user roles, price management, sales recording, and financial reconciliation.

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: React/Next.js
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with tenant isolation via schemas
- **Authentication**: JWT-based with role-based access control
- **Deployment**: Azure (planned)

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Week 1-2)
- [x] Database schema design
- [x] Multi-tenant architecture setup
- [x] Authentication and authorization system
- [x] Backend API foundation
- [x] Frontend project structure

### Phase 2: Station Management (Week 3)
- [ ] Station CRUD operations
- [ ] Pump management
- [ ] Nozzle configuration
- [ ] Fuel price management
- [ ] User role assignment to stations

### Phase 3: Sales Recording System (Week 4)
- [ ] Sales entry interface
- [ ] Previous reading retrieval
- [ ] Automatic calculations
- [ ] Credit tracking system
- [ ] Reconciliation workflow

### Phase 4: Reporting and Analytics (Week 5)
- [ ] Daily/weekly/monthly sales reports
- [ ] Station performance metrics
- [ ] Fuel consumption analytics
- [ ] Credit settlement tracking
- [ ] CSV/Excel export functionality

### Phase 5: Admin Features & Refinement (Week 6)
- [ ] Tenant management for admin
- [ ] Plan-based feature restrictions
- [ ] Billing integration
- [ ] UI/UX refinements
- [ ] Performance optimizations

## Tenant Schema Strategy
We're using a schema-per-tenant approach in PostgreSQL, which provides:
- Strong data isolation between tenants
- Simplified backup/restore per tenant
- Clean permission management
- Better scalability for large tenants

## Security Measures
- JWT authentication with short expiration
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Role-based access control
- Session tracking and audit logs
- Input validation and sanitization
- PostgreSQL schema isolation

## Data Flow for Key Operations

### Sales Recording Process
1. Employee selects station and nozzle
2. System retrieves last cumulative reading
3. Employee enters new cumulative reading
4. System calculates volume = new reading - previous reading
5. System retrieves current fuel price
6. System calculates amount = volume * price
7. Employee enters payment details (cash, credit, etc.)
8. System validates and records the sale
9. If credit is given, creditor balance is updated

### End of Day Reconciliation
1. Manager selects station and date
2. System retrieves all sales for that day
3. System calculates totals (cash, credit, etc.)
4. Manager enters card and UPI totals
5. System verifies total sales = cash + credit + card + UPI
6. Manager finalizes reconciliation
7. System locks the day's records

## Monitoring and Maintenance
- Daily database backups
- Error logging and monitoring
- Regular security audits
- Performance monitoring
- Database index optimization

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
- Mobile application for on-the-go sales recording
- Inventory management system
- Integration with accounting software
- Loyalty program for customers
- Automated price updates based on market rates
