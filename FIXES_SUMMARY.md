# FuelSync Hub - Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the fixes made to address issues with the FuelSync Hub platform.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Database Schema Compatibility

**Problem**: Seed scripts were using incorrect column names for tables like `creditors` and `sales`.

**Solution**:
- Updated seed scripts to match the actual database schema
- Fixed column names in `creditors` table (using `party_name` instead of `name`)
- Fixed column names in `sales` table (using correct field names for sales records)
- Fixed column names in `credit_payments` table (using `recorded_by` instead of `created_by`)

### 2. Tenant User Login Issues

**Problem**: Unable to login with tenant users (owner, manager, employee).

**Solution**:
- Created a dedicated seed script (`seed-tenant-users.ts`) to ensure tenant users are created with correct credentials
- Added logic to update passwords for existing users
- Ensured proper station and user assignments
- Added a test script (`test-tenant-login.js`) to verify login functionality

### 3. Admin Tenant Management Issues

**Problem**: Unable to edit tenants in the admin interface.

**Solution**:
- Fixed the admin tenant controller to properly handle tenant updates
- Updated the tenant service to correctly process tenant data
- Added proper error handling for duplicate emails
- Ensured tenant ID is correctly passed to the API

### 4. Dashboard Routing Issues

**Problem**: Recent tenants section on dashboard not routing correctly.

**Solution**:
- Updated the DashboardRecentTenants component to use correct routing paths
- Ensured links use the `/admin/` prefix for admin routes
- Fixed the router configuration to handle admin routes properly

### 5. User Creation Form Issues

**Problem**: Confusion with owner dropdown when creating users.

**Solution**:
- Updated the UserForm component to handle the owner role correctly
- Added validation to prevent multiple owners per tenant
- Disabled editing of owner accounts
- Made the form conditionally show fields based on the current user's role

### 6. Missing Credit Reports

**Problem**: No data showing in credit reports.

**Solution**:
- Created a seed script (`seed-credit-sales.ts`) for credit sales data
- Added a creditor and credit sales with payments
- Updated package.json to include the credit sales seed script
- Added verification steps to check credit sales data

### 7. Comprehensive Seed Process

**Problem**: Multiple seed scripts needed to be run separately.

**Solution**:
- Created a comprehensive seed script (`seed-all.ts`) that runs all necessary seed operations in the correct order
- Updated package.json to include the new script
- Added detailed documentation on how to use the seed scripts

## Testing and Verification

### Updated Testing Guide

- Added step-by-step instructions for testing all roles
- Included troubleshooting for common issues
